# 3-seconds-hybrid-dynamic-whitelist
PHP&amp;LUA Hybrid whitelist with a 3 second poll - A dynamic whitelist project I created yearsssssssss ago

# How it works
Keys are based off user-agent fingerprints
There is a 3 second time system which means every 3s the whitelist result changes
The lua side is mostly composed of encoding libraries & functions
