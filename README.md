# 3-seconds-hybrid-dynamic-whitelist
PHP&amp;LUA Hybrid whitelist with a 3 second poll - A dynamic whitelist project I created yearsssssssss ago

# How it works
Keys are based off user-agent fingerprints
There is a 3 second time system which means every 3s the whitelist result changes
The lua side is mostly composed of encoding libraries & functions

# Should I use this
If you're not really securing anything worth caring about too much, Sure go for it.
But keep in mind this is literally a public whitelist who anyone can just find and use and reverse... please weigh your options... ( please )

Also I was still discovering things and really new to php ( not much for lua & I know every way this could be exploited and reversed on the client side but it's for more advanced people with a debugging environment! ) so, it will probably have some obscure or really stupid flaw that lets you explode the vps its being hosted on ( idk im not the php master, ai didn't even exist back then! ðŸ˜­)

# Use cases
### Learning ðŸ§ ðŸ¦• - Who doesn't love learning!
### This can work on Roblox studio plugins, quite well actually ðŸ‘€
### And um the darker side of things *cough cough* **exploits...**
