# 3-seconds-hybrid-dynamic-whitelist
PHP&amp;LUA Hybrid whitelist with a 3 second poll - A dynamic whitelist project I created yearsssssssss ago

# How it works
Keys are based off user-agent fingerprints
There is a 3 second time system which means every 3s the whitelist result changes
The lua side is mostly composed of encoding libraries & functions

# Should I use this
If you're not really securing anything worth caring about too much, Sure go for it.
But keep in mind this is literally a public whitelist who anyone can just find and use and reverse... please weigh your options... ( please )

# Use cases
## Learning ðŸ§ ðŸ¦• - Who doesn't love learning!
## This can work on Roblox studio plugins, quite well actually ðŸ‘€
## And um the darker side of things *cough cough* **exploits...**
